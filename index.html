The aim of the Discord is to create nusociety.
I'm not entirely sure what nusociety should or will be, but it's based around this idea:<br>
>>>Humans work best when they're in small communities where each person has purpose<<<<br>
The plan for the near future is to gather a significant amount of active members, each with a role/purpose that he/she is happy with.
and eventually then split into smaller groups with no communication between groups aside from group leaders.<br>
The smaller groups will then agree on a purpose and work together towards this purpose, it could be anything eg. Art project, album, music video, charity awareness, whatever that group wants. <br>
The groups will engage in healthy competition to encourage projects to be successful. The most successful projects will get the most exposure to the whole society.<br>
No one is expected to do anything to be a part of this, if you just want to chat and be along for the ride thats absolutely fine. But Ideally you should find a role within a group. Even if your role is something as simple as entertaining everyone.
